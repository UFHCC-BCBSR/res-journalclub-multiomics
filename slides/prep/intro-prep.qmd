## What is Multi-Omics? {.scrollable}

**Definition:** Integration of multiple high-throughput molecular profiling technologies, each measuring a different layer of cellular regulation.

**Core Omics Types:**

- Genomics: DNA sequence and variation

- Epigenomics: DNA modifications and chromatin structure

- Transcriptomics: RNA expression levels

- Proteomics: Protein abundance and modifications

- Metabolomics: Small molecule metabolites

**Extended Definition (2026):** Also includes imaging data (radiomics), flow cytometry (CyTOF), spatial information, and clinical/phenotypic co-variates.

::: {.notes}
The field has evolved from measuring single molecular layers to comprehensive profiling across multiple layers simultaneously. The 2021 paper uses this broad definition, acknowledging that "omics" now extends beyond traditional molecular measurements to include any high-dimensional biological data type.

## Two Primary Goals of Multi-Omics Studies {.scrollable}

![](fig1.png){width="90%"}

**1. Sample-Focused Analysis:** Classify and understand biological samples

**2. Feature-Focused Analysis:** Identify relationships between molecular features across layers

::: {.notes}
Figure 1 from the paper illustrates these two complementary approaches. The distinction is crucial: sample-focused approaches ask "how are these patients different?" while feature-focused approaches ask "how do molecular layers interact to produce phenotypes?"
:::

---

## Goal 1: Sample-Focused Analysis {.scrollable}

**Objective:** Improve classification and stratification of biological samples

**Unsupervised Approaches:**

- Integrative clustering to discover sample groupings

- Latent factor models to extract underlying variation patterns

- Example: Identifying cancer subtypes from multi-omics profiles

**Supervised Approaches:**

- Predict clinical outcomes or other response variables

- Identify biomarkers associated with outcomes

- Example: Precision medicine treatment selection

**Key Advantage:** Captures complex relationships across data types that single-omics approaches miss

::: {.notes}
Sample-focused analysis is particularly important in precision medicine. For example, integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics can identify cancer subtypes that look similar at one molecular layer but differ at another, leading to different treatment responses. The paper emphasizes that multi-omics clustering often reveals groups that are invisible in single-omics analysis.
:::

---

## Goal 2: Feature-Focused Analysis {.scrollable}

**Objective:** Understand regulatory mechanisms across molecular layers

**Approaches:**

- Identify relationships between specific feature pairs (e.g., methylation-expression)

- Build multilayered regulatory networks

- Infer how regulation flows from DNA → RNA → Protein → Metabolite

**Examples from Literature:**

- Gene expression and methylation studies

- Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS): linking genetic variants to expression

- Metabolic flux balance analysis with transcriptomics integration

**Ultimate Goal:** Systems biology models that explain molecular mechanisms of health and disease

::: {.notes}
This is the "holy grail" of multi-omics - understanding how molecular regulation actually works. The paper notes that while this is often claimed as a goal, most studies still fall short of delivering true mechanistic models. Instead, they identify correlations or run pathway enrichment separately for each omics type. The challenge is moving from correlation to causation and from static snapshots to dynamic regulatory models.
:::

---

## Analysis Strategies: Independent vs. Integrative {.scrollable}

**Historical Approach:** Analyze each omics independently, then combine results

- Easy to implement

- Misses cross-layer interactions

- Less statistical power

**Modern Integrative Approaches:**

**Meta-analysis methods:** Combine statistical evidence across layers

**Bayesian methods:** Model relationships with prior knowledge

**Latent factor analysis:** Extract shared variation patterns (e.g., MOFA)

**Machine/deep learning:** Pattern recognition across modalities

**Regression-based:** Model one layer as function of others (e.g., mixOmics)

**Hybrid Example:** mixOmics performs outcome prediction AND builds co-regulation networks

::: {.notes}
The field has evolved from simple independent analysis to sophisticated integration methods. The paper emphasizes that the choice of method should depend on the research question. Some methods (like mixOmics) attempt to achieve both goals simultaneously - classifying samples while also identifying regulatory relationships. This is powerful but requires careful interpretation to avoid circular reasoning.

## Key Open Questions in Multi-Omics {.scrollable}

**Methodological Questions:**

- How do we move from correlation to causation in multi-omics networks?

- How should temporal dynamics be integrated into multi-omics models?

- What is the optimal experimental design for different research questions?

**Biological Questions:**

- Which regulatory relationships are consistent across contexts vs. condition-specific?

- How do post-translational modifications fit into multi-omics regulatory models?

- Can we build predictive models of cellular state from multi-omics data?

**Practical Questions:**

- What is the minimum viable multi-omics experiment for a given question?

- How do we validate multi-omics biomarkers for clinical use?

- When does multi-omics provide value beyond well-executed single-omics?

::: {.notes}
These questions frame the current state of the field. The paper notes that while we have many powerful analysis methods, fundamental questions about interpretation, validation, and clinical translation remain largely unanswered. The field needs to move beyond method development to address these core questions.

## Major Challenge: Heterogeneity Across Omics {.scrollable}

![](fig3.png){width="90%"}

**Different technologies have vastly different properties:**

- Signal-to-noise ratios vary widely

- Number of detected features differs by orders of magnitude

- Coverage of molecular space is incomplete and biased

- Statistical power varies substantially across platforms

**Critical Implication:** Lack of detected association may reflect technical limitations rather than biological absence

::: {.notes}
Figure 3 uses the STATegra dataset to demonstrate these differences. Panel a shows RNA-seq has high signal and low noise while proteomics has lower signal and higher noise. Panel b shows RNA-seq detects ~10,000 features while metabolomics only ~4,000. Panel c shows different coverage of feature space. Panel d shows resulting power differences. This is especially problematic when studying cross-layer relationships like gene-protein correlation - the proteomics limitations constrain the entire analysis.

## Major Challenges: Summary {.scrollable}

![](fig2.png){width="90%"}

**Four Key Challenge Areas:**

**1. Missing Values:** Incomplete sample coverage, platform limitations, technical failures

**2. Interpretability:** Difficulty building queryable systems models from complex multi-omics data

**3. Data Sharing:** Distributed storage, inconsistent annotation, lack of standards

**4. Computational Performance:** Scalability, resource requirements, need for cloud infrastructure

::: {.notes}
Figure 2 summarizes challenges and potential solutions. The paper emphasizes that while these are technical challenges, they have profound implications for biological interpretation. For example, missing value imputation can create dependencies between omics layers that invalidate subsequent correlation analyses. The field treats these as "just preprocessing" when they actually affect core statistical assumptions.

## Single-Cell Multi-Omics: Future Opportunities {.scrollable}

**Why Single-Cell Multi-Omics Matters:**

- Accounts for cell-type heterogeneity (crucial for tumors, brain, immune system)

- Enables cell-type-specific regulatory models

- Links molecular states to cellular phenotypes

**Current Technologies:**

- Parallel methods: measure multiple omics from the same cell (e.g., 10x Multiome, CITE-seq)

- Non-parallel methods: integrate datasets across modalities using computational matching

**New Dimensions Available at Single-Cell Level:**

- CRISPR perturbations

- Spatial localization

- Lineage tracing

- Trajectory inference

::: {.notes}
Single-cell represents the future of multi-omics. Bulk measurements average across cell types, hiding important biology. The paper emphasizes that parallel methods (measuring multiple omics from the same cell) are ideal but still limited in throughput and modality coverage. Non-parallel integration requires matching cell types across datasets - a challenging computational problem with strong assumptions.
:::

## Single-Cell Multi-Omics: Challenges Amplified {.scrollable}

**Technical Challenges:**

- Extreme sparsity, especially in scATAC-seq

- Limited protein capture (targeted panels only)

- Low read coverage per cell

- Technology-specific noise and bias

**Analytical Challenges:**

- Cell-type matching across non-parallel datasets

- Handling dropout and missing values

- Computational scaling (millions of cells)

- Building interpretable models from sparse single-cell data

**Major Update Since 2021:** Spatial omics revolution preserves tissue architecture and cell-cell interactions

::: {.notes}
Single-cell amplifies all the challenges of bulk multi-omics. Sparsity is perhaps the biggest issue - many genes or chromatin regions are not detected even when present. The 2021 paper predates the explosion of spatial omics technologies (10x Visium, MERFISH, Xenium, CosMx for transcriptomics; MIBI, IMC, CODEX for proteomics). Spatial approaches preserve tissue context, which is crucial for understanding tumor microenvironments and other tissue-level biology.

## Where is the Field Going? {.scrollable}

**Emerging Consensus Areas:**

- Cloud computing is becoming standard for large-scale analysis

- Latent factor models are widely adopted for integration

- Single-cell multi-omics is replacing bulk approaches

- Spatial information is increasingly recognized as essential

**Persistent Debates:**

- Supervised vs. unsupervised approaches for biomarker discovery

- When to use complex integration vs. simpler separate analyses

- How to validate multi-omics findings across cohorts

- Path from research findings to clinical implementation

**Technology Trends (Post-2021):**

- Foundation models and large language models for biology

- Improved proteomics coverage (Olink, SomaScan)

- Multi-omics single-cell kits becoming commercially available

- Knowledge graphs for systems biology integration

::: {.notes}
The field is coalescing around certain approaches while key questions remain open. The 2021 paper couldn't anticipate the AI/foundation model revolution in biology (2023-2024), which is now changing how we think about multi-omics integration. The practical question of when multi-omics is worth the additional cost and complexity compared to well-designed single-omics experiments remains largely unanswered.

## Open Questions for Series Discussion {.scrollable}

**For Cancer Biology:**

- Which cancer questions truly require multi-omics approaches?

- How do we integrate TCGA data (good genomics/transcriptomics) with limited proteomics/metabolomics?

- Can multi-omics predict therapy resistance better than genomics alone?

**For Methods Development:**

- How do we assess whether integration methods add value vs. single-omics?

- What validation strategies establish confidence in multi-omics biomarkers?

- How should we handle the tradeoff between model complexity and interpretability?

**For Clinical Translation:**

- What is the path from multi-omics biomarker discovery to FDA approval?

- How do we design cost-effective clinical multi-omics assays?

- Which omics provide the most value for specific clinical questions?

::: {.notes}
These questions should guide the journal club series. The goal is not just to learn methods, but to critically evaluate when and how multi-omics approaches add value to cancer research. The paper raises many of these questions without providing definitive answers - that's because the field is still working them out.

## Planning the Multi-Omics Integration Series {.scrollable}

**Proposed Session Topics:**

**Session 1 (Today):** Definitions, goals, and landscape overview

**Session 2:** Statistical methods deep-dive (latent factors, Bayesian approaches, regularization)

**Session 3:** Cancer applications (TCGA multi-omics, precision oncology case studies)

**Session 4:** Single-cell multi-omics technologies and analysis methods

**Session 5:** Spatial multi-omics and tumor microenvironment

**Session 6:** Clinical translation challenges and regulatory considerations

**Session 7:** Practical analysis demonstration OR AI/foundation models in multi-omics

**For Each Session:** Balance between methods understanding and biological interpretation

::: {.notes}
This series structure moves from conceptual foundations to practical applications. Session 5 on spatial omics is crucial but missing from the 2021 review. Session 7 could either be a hands-on analysis workshop or a discussion of emerging AI approaches - we can decide based on group interest. Each session should include both computational methods and biological examples to maintain relevance to cancer research questions.
