# Session Goals

In this session we will:

- Define the major omics layers and what each measures  
- Distinguish **parallel vs non-parallel** multi-omics  
- Distinguish **integrative vs meta-analytic** approaches  
- Understand **sample-focused vs feature-focused** analyses  
- Recognize **challenges in multi-omics analysis**

---

# Multi-Omics Definitions

> **Multi-omics analysis** integrates multiple molecular data layers measured on the same biological system to capture complementary aspects of regulation, state, and phenotype.
**Key idea:**  
Each omics layer provides a partial and complementary view of biology.

---

## Why Multi-Omics Exists

Single-omic analyses answer limited questions:
- What mutations exist?
- Which genes are expressed?
Multi-omics enables deeper questions:
- Which mutations are *functional*?
- How regulation, expression, and phenotype connect
- Why similar tumors behave differently

## Multi-Omics Layers: Genomics {.smaller auto-animate=true}
| Omics Layer | Definition | Common Technologies | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Genomics** | Characterizes DNA sequence variation, including germline and somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants. | • WGS<br>• WES<br>• Targeted gene panels | Cancer drivers and susceptibility, clonal structure and evolution |
## Multi-Omics Layers: Epigenomics {.smaller auto-animate=true}
| Omics Layer | Definition | Common Technologies | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Epigenomics** | Measures chromatin state and DNA modifications that regulate gene accessibility without altering DNA sequence. | • ATAC-seq<br>• ChIP-seq / CUT&RUN<br>• DNA methylation sequencing | Regulatory potential, cell identity and lineage memory |
## Multi-Omics Layers: Transcriptomics {.smaller auto-animate=true}
| Omics Layer | Definition | Common Technologies | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Transcriptomics** | Quantifies RNA abundance to capture active gene expression programs. | • Bulk RNA-seq<br>• Single-cell RNA-seq<br>• Spatial transcriptomics | Pathway activation, cell states, tumor microenvironment |
## Multi-Omics Layers: Proteomics {.smaller auto-animate=true}
| Omics Layer | Definition | Common Technologies | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Proteomics** | Measures protein abundance, modifications, and interactions—the functional machinery of the cell. | • Mass spectrometry-based proteomics<br>• RPPA, CyTOF | Pathway activation at functional level, drug target engagement |
## Multi-Omics Layers: Metabolomics {.smaller auto-animate=true}
| Omics Layer | Definition | Common Technologies | Why It Matters |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Metabolomics** | Profiles small molecules reflecting biochemical activity and metabolic flux. | • LC-MS / GC-MS<br>• Targeted vs untargeted | Phenotype-proximal biology, metabolic reprogramming |

# Multi-Omics Data Generation

## Multi-Modal vs Non-Parallel Multi-Omics
**Parallel (matched samples)**
- Multiple omics measured on the same samples
- Enables direct integration
**Non-parallel**
- Different cohorts, platforms, or timepoints
- Requires alignment or meta-analysis

---

### Example: Multi-Modal
- TCGA: genomics + transcriptomics on same tumors (parallel)
- Public RNA-seq + private proteomics cohorts (non-parallel)
**Key takeaway**
> Not all multi-omics data are integrable.

---

### Example: Non-Parallel
- TCGA: genomics + transcriptomics on same tumors (parallel)
- Public RNA-seq + private proteomics cohorts (non-parallel)
**Key takeaway**
> Not all multi-omics data are integrable.

# Multi-Omics Data Analysis

---

## Integrative Analysis vs Meta-Analysis
**Meta-analysis**
- Combine results *after* independent analyses
- Example: overlap of enriched pathways
**Integrative analysis**
- Joint modeling across omics layers
- Example: latent factor models (e.g., MOFA-like frameworks)

### Example: Integrated Analysis

**Key takeaway**

---

## Sample-Focused vs Feature-Focused
**Sample-Focused**
- Stratify or cluster samples
- Example: overlap of enriched pathways
**Feature-Focused**
- Infer biological mechanisms

# Spatial Multi-Omics

---

## Why Spatial Multi-Omics Matters
Bulk and single-cell analyses lose context:
- Bulk averages erase spatial structure
- scRNA-seq loses tissue architecture
**Spatial omics preserves**
- Cell–cell interactions
- Tissue niches
- Functional microenvironments

---

### Example: Tumor-Immune Boundary Signaling
![Spatial transcriptomics of tumor microenvironment](figures/spatial-tumor-immune.png){.r-stretch}

**Key insight**
> Same expression ≠ same function in different locations

---

### Example: Stromal Gradients in Cancer Progression
![Spatial metabolomics showing stromal gradients](figures/spatial-stromal-gradient.png){.r-stretch}

**Key insight**
> Spatial context reveals mechanisms invisible to bulk analysis

# Challenges in Multi-Omics Analysis

---

## Why Multi-Omics is Challenging

So far, we've focused on:
- What different omics layers measure
- How multi-omics analyses are performed
Next, we'll shift to:
- Why multi-omics analyses are challenging in practice

---

### Example: Heterogeneity Across Omics Layers
![RNA-protein discordance in tumors](figures/rna-protein-discordance.png){.r-stretch}

**Common observations:**
- RNA–protein discordance
- Open chromatin without expression
- Metabolic changes without transcriptional shifts

**Important framing**
> Disagreement across omics is often the signal, not the noise.

---

### Example: Missing Data in Multi-Omics
![Missingness patterns across omics platforms](figures/missing-data-patterns.png){.r-stretch}

**Types of missingness:**
- Missing by design (not assayed)
- Missing not at random (low abundance)
- Platform-specific dropout

**Why it matters:**
- Breaks naïve integration methods
- Forces modeling assumptions
- Limits interpretability

---

## Key Takeaways
- Each omics layer answers a different question
- Multi-omics is a *framework*, not a checklist
- Integration requires careful design
- Complexity is the cost of biological realism
