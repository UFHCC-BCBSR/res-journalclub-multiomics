## What Is Multi-Omics Integration?

> **Multi-omics integration** combines measurements from multiple molecular layers of the same biological system to reveal regulatory relationships, functional states, and disease mechanisms invisible to single-layer analysis.

**Central principle:** Biological regulation operates across molecular layers—each omics modality captures one view of this connected system.

## The Multi-Layered Biology of Cells

![Multi-layer information flow from genome to metabolome](figures/central-dogma-multilayer.png)

**Genome → Epigenome → Transcriptome → Proteome → Metabolome**

- Each layer represents a different level of biological organization
- Regulation flows across layers but is not strictly linear
- Feedback loops and post-transcriptional control create complex layer-to-layer relationships

**Why multi-omics?** Single-layer measurements answer "what is present?" Multi-omics answers "what is active, regulated, and functional?"

---

## Genomics: The Blueprint

**What it measures:** DNA sequence variation including germline and somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and structural rearrangements

**Common technologies:**
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
- Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
- Targeted gene panels

![Genomics technology comparison across platforms and study designs](figures/genomics-technologies.png)

---

## Genomics: Mapping Drivers and Vulnerabilities

![TCGA pan-cancer mutation landscape](figures/tcga-mutation-landscape.png)

**Key insight:** Genomics identifies recurrent driver alterations across cancer types and reveals mutation mechanisms (point mutations, amplifications, deletions).

**What genomics tells us:**
- Cancer susceptibility and clonal evolution
- Targetable alterations and resistance mechanisms

**What it doesn't tell us:** Whether mutated pathways are transcriptionally active, whether proteins are expressed, or how the regulatory environment shapes phenotype.

**Takeaway:** Genomics defines potential—integration with other layers reveals realized biology.

---

## Epigenomics: The Regulatory Layer

**What it measures:** Chromatin state and DNA modifications that control gene accessibility without altering DNA sequence

**Common technologies:**
- ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility)
- ChIP-seq / CUT&RUN (transcription factor binding, histone modifications)
- Bisulfite sequencing (DNA methylation: WGBS, RRBS)

![Epigenomics assay types and their biological readouts](figures/epigenomics-assays.png)

---

## Epigenomics: Mechanisms of Transcriptional Control

![CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer](figures/cimp-colorectal.png)

**Key insight:** DNA methylation at CpG islands can silence tumor suppressors independently of mutation, defining distinct molecular and clinical subtypes.

**What epigenomics tells us:**
- Which genes are poised for expression vs silenced
- Cell identity and lineage commitment
- Regulatory mechanisms underlying phenotype switching

**Takeaway:** Epigenomics reveals *regulatory potential*—which parts of the genome are accessible and how transcription factors can act. Integration with transcriptomics distinguishes potential from realized activity.

---

## Transcriptomics: Active Gene Expression

**What it measures:** RNA abundance reflecting active transcriptional programs

**Common technologies:**
- Bulk RNA-seq (population average)
- Single-cell RNA-seq (cell-level resolution)
- Spatial transcriptomics (tissue architecture)

![Transcriptomics technology comparison](figures/transcriptomics-technologies.png)

---

## Transcriptomics: Defining Cellular States and Subtypes

![PAM50 breast cancer subtypes based on gene expression](figures/pam50-breast-subtypes.png)

**Key insight:** Expression-based classification (PAM50) identifies breast cancer subtypes with distinct biology and clinical behavior, independent of receptor status alone.

**What transcriptomics tells us:**
- Active signaling pathways and regulatory programs
- Cell states, heterogeneity, and tumor microenvironment composition
- Molecular subtypes with therapeutic relevance

**Limitation:** RNA abundance ≠ protein abundance ≠ activity. Post-transcriptional regulation and protein stability decouple mRNA from functional output.

**Takeaway:** Transcriptomics captures gene expression programs but requires integration with proteomics to understand functional consequences.

---

## Proteomics: The Functional Machinery

**What it measures:** Protein abundance, post-translational modifications, and interactions—the direct effectors of cellular function

**Common technologies:**
- Mass spectrometry–based proteomics (discovery, targeted)
- Antibody-based platforms (RPPA, CyTOF)

![Proteomics workflow and technology platforms](figures/proteomics-platforms.png)

---

## Proteomics: From Measurement to Clinical Action

![HER2 assessment across genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers](figures/cptac-her2-multilayer.png)

**Key insight:** HER2 classification varies dramatically by layer. RNA-protein correlation is only 0.53. Samples classified as HER2-positive by protein may be negative by RNA or copy number.

**What proteomics tells us:**
- Functional protein levels for therapy decisions (e.g., anti-HER2 treatment)
- Post-transcriptional regulation and protein stability effects
- Discordance between genomic/transcriptomic potential and protein reality

**Takeaway:** For many clinical decisions, protein measurement is essential. Discordance across layers motivates multi-omics integration to capture the full regulatory cascade from DNA → RNA → protein.

---

## Metabolomics: Biochemical Activity and Regulation

**What it measures:** Small molecules reflecting metabolic flux, enzymatic activity, and microenvironmental conditions

**Common technologies:**
- Liquid/gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS, GC-MS)
- Targeted vs untargeted metabolomics
- Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy

![Metabolomics experimental workflow](figures/metabolomics-workflow.png)

---

## Metabolomics: Connecting Metabolism to Regulation

![Metabolites as regulatory molecules connecting omics layers](figures/metabolites-in-multiomes.png)

**Key insight:** Metabolites are not just endpoints—they are regulatory signals. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) drives DNA and histone methylation; acetyl-CoA enables histone acetylation; lactate modifies protein function.

**What metabolomics tells us:**
- How metabolic state regulates gene expression through epigenetic modifications
- Phenotype-proximal biology (closer to observable disease than genomics)
- Metabolic reprogramming in cancer and immune cells

**Takeaway:** Metabolomics reveals bidirectional regulation: metabolism shapes epigenetics and protein function, creating feedback loops across omics layers. This motivates integrative analysis to capture systems-level regulation.

---

## Two Paradigms for Multi-Omics Studies

![Schematic showing parallel vs joint profiling multi-omics](figures/multiomics-paradigms.png)

**Parallel Multi-Omics (Matched Samples):**
- Multiple omics measured on the same samples (e.g., tumor aliquots)
- Enables direct layer-to-layer correlation and integration
- Examples: TCGA, CPTAC

**Joint Profiling Multi-Omics:**
- Multiple omics measured from the same cells or spatial locations
- Requires specialized single-cell or spatial technologies
- Examples: CITE-seq (scRNA + protein), 10X Multiome (scATAC + scRNA), spatial metabolomics + transcriptomics

**Why this distinction matters:** Different technologies enable different biological questions and require different integration approaches.

---

## Parallel Multi-Omics: Integrating Matched Tumor Profiles

![TCGA-based study integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and outcomes](figures/parallel-study-example-tcga.png)

**Study design:** Multi-platform profiling of the same tumor samples (WES, RNA-seq, methylation, proteomics) to link molecular alterations to clinical outcomes.

**Key findings:** 
- Mutation-expression relationships reveal functional consequences of genomic alterations
- Multi-omics subtypes better predict treatment response than single-layer classification
- Integration identifies which genomic drivers are transcriptionally/proteomically active

**Takeaway:** Parallel multi-omics on matched samples enables direct integration across layers, revealing which molecular alterations drive phenotype and which are passenger events.

---

## Joint Profiling Technologies: Single-Cell Multi-Omics

| **Omics Combination** | **Example Technologies** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Genome + Transcriptome | G&T-seq, SCTG, DR-seq, TARGET-seq, sci-L3-RNA/DNA, scONE-seq |
| Epigenome + Transcriptome | scCAT-seq, sci-CAR, SNARE-seq, SHARE-seq, ASTAR-seq, Paired-Tag |
| Transcriptome + Protein | REAP-seq, CITE-seq, ASAP-seq |
| Transcriptome + CRISPR Perturbations | Perturb-seq, CROP-seq |
| Epigenome + Protein | ICICLE-seq, ASAP-seq, PHAGE-ATAC |
| Triple Modality | TEA-seq, DOGMA-seq (RNA + protein + chromatin) |

**Advantage:** Eliminates batch effects and sample heterogeneity—all measurements from the same cells.

**Emerging:** Spatial multi-omics maintains tissue architecture.

---

## Joint Profiling: Spatial Multi-Omics of Breast Cancer

![Spatial multiomics reveals tumor microenvironment organization](figures/multimodal-study-example.jpg)

**Study design:** Spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics integrated with tissue architecture to map the breast tumor microenvironment.

**Key findings:**
- Spatially organized immune and stromal niches influence tumor evolution
- Metabolic gradients within tumors drive spatially distinct transcriptional programs
- Integration of modalities reveals cell-cell communication networks

**Takeaway:** Joint spatial profiling reveals how molecular layers interact within tissue architecture—biology that parallel bulk approaches cannot capture. Clinical promise includes predicting therapy response based on spatial organization.

---

## Joint Profiling: Metabolic Reprogramming in Pancreatic Cancer

![Integrated spatial omics of metabolic reprogramming](figures/multimodal-pancreatic-cancer.jpg)

**Study design:** Spatial metabolomics integrated with spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to map metabolic rewiring in pancreatic tumors.

**Key findings (Panel A):** 
- Serine/glycine metabolism enzymes (GLUL, GLS, ASNS) show spatially distinct expression in tumor vs stroma
- Glutamate-derived pathways (GOT2, ALDH18A1) are heterogeneous within the tumor microenvironment

**Key findings (Panels B-F):**
- Sequential metabolic pathways mapped spatially: arginine → ornithine → polyamines
- Enzyme expression (ASL, ASS1, ODC1, SRM, SMS) corresponds to metabolite spatial distribution
- Integration reveals metabolic compartmentalization between tumor, stroma, and immune regions

**Takeaway:** Spatial integration of metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics maps metabolic reprogramming at cellular resolution. This reveals tumor-stroma metabolic crosstalk and identifies spatially restricted metabolic vulnerabilities for targeted therapy.

---

## Integrative Analysis vs Meta-Analysis

**Meta-analysis:**
- Analyze each omics layer independently
- Combine results post-analysis (e.g., pathway enrichment overlap)
- Answers: "Do genomic and transcriptomic analyses independently support this pathway?"

**Integrative analysis:**
- Joint statistical modeling across omics layers
- Leverages cross-layer structure during analysis (e.g., latent factor models, network inference)
- Answers: "Which latent factors or regulatory networks explain coordinated variation across layers?"

**Why this distinction matters:**
- Integration can reveal cross-layer relationships invisible to separate analyses
- But integration requires stronger assumptions and careful interpretation
- Different methods suit different biological questions

---

## Two Analytical Paradigms for Integration

![Multi-omics integration strategies for different goals](figures/integration-approaches.png)

::: {.columns}

## Sample-Focused Integration: Molecular Subtyping

![Multi-omics clustering identifies glioma subtypes with clinical relevance](figures/sample-focused-clustering.png)

**Analytical approach:** Consensus clustering integrating mRNA, lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and mutation profiles to classify glioma patients.

**Key findings:**
- Three molecular subtypes identified with distinct multi-omics signatures (panels A-C)
- Subtypes show significantly different survival outcomes (panel D)
- Integration provides stronger prognostic stratification than single-omics classification

**Takeaway:** Sample-focused integration groups patients into clinically meaningful subtypes by leveraging complementary information across omics layers. This approach is critical for precision medicine—identifying which patients will benefit from specific therapies.

---

## Feature-Focused Integration: Regulatory Networks

![SCENIC infers TF regulatory networks from multi-omics data](figures/scenic-melanoma-regulatory-network.png)

**Analytical approach:** SCENIC integrates scRNA-seq with TF motif analysis and ATAC-seq chromatin accessibility to infer gene regulatory networks governing melanoma cell states.

**Key findings:**
- **Panel a:** Regulon activity heatmap reveals TF programs distinguishing melanocytic, intermediate, and mesenchymal states
- **Panel b:** UMAP based on regulon activities (not genes) separates intermediate state—regulatory programs define cell identity
- **Panel c:** ATAC-seq validates that predicted TF binding sites are accessible in the corresponding cell states

**Takeaway:** Feature-focused integration identifies *mechanisms*—which transcription factors regulate cell state transitions and how chromatin accessibility enables this regulation. This analysis reveals the regulatory logic connecting epigenomics to transcriptomics, impossible to capture from either layer alone.

## Challenges in Multi-Omics Integration

Having established what multi-omics can reveal, we now consider practical challenges that shape study design and interpretation—challenges that our upcoming speakers will address in their research.

**Key challenges:**

1. **Layer-to-layer discordance** is often the biological signal, not measurement error
2. **Missing data** across layers complicates integration and forces modeling assumptions
3. **Batch effects and technical variation** differ across platforms
4. **Interpretability** decreases as model complexity increases

---

## Discordance Across Layers: Signal or Noise?

**Common observations:**
- RNA–protein correlation is often modest (ρ ~ 0.4–0.6)
- Open chromatin without gene expression
- Metabolic shifts without transcriptional changes

**Critical reframing:**
> Disagreement across omics layers is often the biological signal—revealing post-transcriptional regulation, protein stability effects, and metabolic control of gene expression.

**Example revisited:** HER2 protein positivity without RNA overexpression indicates post-transcriptional or protein stability mechanisms, creating distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities.

**Implication:** Integration methods must distinguish biological discordance from technical noise.

---

## Missing Data in Multi-Omics

**Types of missingness:**
- **Missing by design:** Not all samples profiled on all platforms (cost, sample limitations)
- **Missing not at random:** Low-abundance proteins/metabolites drop out; depends on biology
- **Platform-specific dropout:** Single-cell RNA-seq has high zeros; proteomics misses low-abundance proteins

**Why missingness matters:**
- Breaks naïve integration methods (e.g., correlation-based approaches)
- Requires careful imputation or missingness-aware models
- Limits interpretation: Is a feature absent or undetected?

**Takeaway:** Missing data is a fundamental challenge in multi-omics. Upcoming speakers will discuss how they address missingness in their integration workflows.
