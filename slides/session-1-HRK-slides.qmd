## What Is Multi-Omics?

> **Multi-omics analysis** integrates multiple molecular data layers measured on the same biological system to capture complementary aspects of regulation, state, and phenotype.

**Key idea:** Each omics layer provides a partial and complementary view of biology.

## Why Multi-Omics Exists

![Examples showing limitations of single-omic vs multi-omic approaches](figures/single-vs-multi-omics-comparison.png)

::: notes
Single-omic analyses answer limited questions: What mutations exist? Which genes are expressed? Multi-omics enables deeper questions: Which mutations are functional? How regulation, expression, and phenotype connect. Why similar tumors behave differently.

## The Central Dogma of Biology

![Multi-layer information flow from genome to metabolome](figures/central-dogma-multilayer.png)

**Genome → Epigenome → Transcriptome → Proteome → Metabolome**

- Information flow is not strictly linear
- Each layer captures a different biological abstraction

::: notes
Integration attempts to recover relationships between layers. Classic reference: Hasin et al., Genome Biology 2017.
:::

## Genomics

**Definition:** DNA sequence variation including germline and somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants

**Common technologies:**
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
- Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
- Targeted gene panels

![Genomics technology comparison](figures/genomics-technologies.png)

## Genomics: Why It Matters

![TCGA Pan-Cancer mutation landscape showing recurrent drivers](figures/tcga-mutation-landscape.png)

**What genomics tells us:**
- Cancer drivers and susceptibility
- Clonal structure and evolution
- What *could* happen biologically

::: notes
Concrete example: TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas showing recurrent somatic mutation landscapes across cancers. Key limitation: Genomics does not measure activity or regulation.
:::

---

## Epigenomics

**Definition:** Chromatin state and DNA modifications that regulate gene accessibility without altering DNA sequence

**Common technologies:**
- ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility)
- ChIP-seq / CUT&RUN (TFs, histone marks)
- DNA methylation sequencing (WGBS, RRBS)

![Epigenomics assay types and readouts](figures/epigenomics-assays.png)

## Epigenomics: Why It Matters

![CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer](figures/cimp-colorectal.png)

**What epigenomics tells us:**
- Regulatory potential
- Cell identity and lineage memory
- Mechanisms of transcriptional control

::: notes
Concrete example: CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in colorectal cancer shows how epigenetic silencing drives tumorigenesis independent of mutation.
:::

---

## Transcriptomics

**Definition:** RNA abundance capturing active gene expression programs

**Common technologies:**
- Bulk RNA-seq
- Single-cell RNA-seq
- Spatial transcriptomics

![Transcriptomics technology comparison](figures/transcriptomics-technologies.png)

---

## Transcriptomics: Why It Matters

![PAM50 breast cancer subtypes based on expression](figures/pam50-breast-subtypes.png)

**What transcriptomics tells us:**
- Pathway activation
- Cell states and populations
- Tumor microenvironment composition

::: notes
Concrete example: Expression-based cancer subtypes like PAM50 breast cancer classification. Caveat: RNA abundance ≠ protein abundance ≠ activity.
:::

---

## Proteomics

**Definition:** Protein abundance, modifications, and interactions—the functional machinery of the cell

**Common technologies:**
- Mass spectrometry–based proteomics
- Antibody-based platforms (RPPA, CyTOF)

![Proteomics workflow and platforms](figures/proteomics-platforms.png)

---

## Proteomics: Why It Matters

![CPTAC RNA-protein correlation showing widespread discordance](figures/cptac-rna-protein-discordance.png)

**What proteomics tells us:**
- Pathway activation at the functional level
- Drug target engagement
- Post-translational regulation

::: notes
Concrete example: CPTAC showing widespread RNA–protein discordance in tumors, demonstrating that transcript levels are often poor predictors of protein abundance.
:::

---

## Metabolomics

**Definition:** Small molecules reflecting biochemical activity and metabolic flux

**Common technologies:**
- LC-MS / GC-MS
- Targeted vs untargeted metabolomics

![Metabolomics workflow](figures/metabolomics-workflow.png)

---

## Metabolomics: Why It Matters

![2-hydroxyglutarate accumulation in IDH-mutant gliomas](figures/idh-mutant-2hg.png)

**What metabolomics tells us:**
- Phenotype-proximal biology
- Metabolic reprogramming
- Drug response and toxicity

::: notes
Concrete example: IDH-mutant gliomas produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which drives epigenetic dysregulation and tumorigenesis.
:::

## Parallel vs Non-Parallel vs Multi-Modal Multi-Omics

**Non-parallel:** Different cohorts, platforms, or timepoints → meta-analytic approaches

**Parallel (matched samples):** Multiple omics on the same samples → direct integration

**Multi-Modal:** Multiple omics from the same cells/tissue → integrated analysis tools

![Schematic showing three multi-omics paradigms](figures/multiomics-paradigms.png)

---

## Non-Parallel Multi-Omics: How It Works

![Technology diagram showing separate cohorts for RNA-seq and proteomics](figures/non-parallel-workflow.png)

**Example:** Public RNA-seq + private proteomics cohorts

::: notes
Non-parallel studies require alignment or meta-analytic thinking. Data may come from different technologies, platforms, or timepoints. Integration relies on shared features (e.g., genes) rather than shared samples.
:::

---

## Non-Parallel Multi-Omics: Study Example

![Main results from non-parallel multi-omics study](figures/non-parallel-study-example.png)

::: notes
Example study demonstrating how separate RNA-seq and proteomics cohorts can be analyzed to identify convergent biological signals or validate findings across platforms. Main finding should show concordance or complementarity of results.
:::

---

## Parallel Multi-Omics: How It Works

![TCGA workflow showing genomics and transcriptomics on same tumor samples](figures/parallel-workflow-tcga.png)

**Example:** TCGA genomics + transcriptomics on same tumors

::: notes
Parallel multi-omics measures multiple data types on matched samples. This enables direct correlation, stratification, and integrative modeling. TCGA is the prototypical example with WES, RNA-seq, methylation, and more on the same tumors.
:::

---

## Parallel Multi-Omics: Study Example

![TCGA study showing mutation-expression relationships](figures/parallel-study-example-tcga.png)

::: notes
Example: TCGA studies showing how somatic mutations correlate with expression subtypes, or how methylation patterns predict clinical outcomes. Main finding should demonstrate cross-layer relationships that wouldn't be visible in single-omic analysis.
:::

---

## Multi-Modal Multi-Omics: How It Works

![Multi-modal assay technologies like CITE-seq, 10X Multiome](figures/multimodal-technologies.png)

**Example:** Single-cell technologies measuring multiple layers simultaneously

::: notes
Multi-modal assays measure multiple omics from the same cells or tissue sections. Examples: CITE-seq (RNA + protein), 10X Multiome (ATAC + RNA), PacBio HiFi sequencing (methylation + DNA), spatial multi-omics (RNA + protein in tissue). These enable cell-level integration.
:::

---

## Multi-Modal Multi-Omics: Study Example

![Results from multi-modal study showing cell-level integration](figures/multimodal-study-example.png)

::: notes
Example study using multi-modal technology to reveal cell-type-specific regulation, spatial organization, or disease mechanisms that require simultaneous measurement of multiple layers. Main finding should highlight insights only possible with multi-modal data.

## Integrative Analysis vs Meta-Analysis

**Meta-analysis**
- Combine results *after* independent analyses
- Example: overlap of enriched pathways

**Integrative analysis**
- Joint modeling across omics layers
- Example: latent factor models (e.g., MOFA-like frameworks)

---

## Why This Distinction Matters

- Integration ≠ stacking plots
- Different assumptions
- Different failure modes
- Different interpretability

---

## Sample-Focused Multi-Omics

**Primary goal**
- Stratify or cluster samples

**Examples**
- Cancer subtyping
- Patient stratification
- Treatment response prediction

**Unit of analysis**
- Samples

---

## Feature-Focused Multi-Omics

**Primary goal**
- Infer biological mechanisms

**Examples**
- Regulatory networks
- TF → chromatin → RNA relationships
- Signaling cascades

**Unit of analysis**
- Genes, proteins, regulatory elements

---

## Regulatory Network Example

- ATAC-seq identifies accessible enhancers
- TF binding inferred from motifs or CUT&RUN
- RNA-seq links regulation to expression

**Question asked**
> How does regulation drive expression?

---

## Why Spatial Multi-Omics Matters

Bulk and single-cell analyses lose context:

- Bulk averages erase spatial structure
- scRNA-seq loses tissue architecture

**Spatial omics preserves**
- Cell–cell interactions
- Tissue niches
- Functional microenvironments

---

## Spatial Multi-Omics Example

- Tumor–immune boundary signaling
- Stromal gradients influencing cancer progression

**Key insight**
> Same expression ≠ same function in different locations

---

## Challenges in Multi-omics Analysis

So far, we’ve focused on:
- What different omics layers measure
- How multi-omics analyses are performed

Next, we’ll shift to:
- Why multi-omics analyses are challenging in practice

---

## Heterogeneity Across Omics Layers

Common observations:
- RNA–protein discordance
- Open chromatin without expression
- Metabolic changes without transcriptional shifts

**Important framing**
> Disagreement across omics is often the signal, not the noise.

---

## Missing Data in Multi-Omics

**Types of missingness**
- Missing by design (not assayed)
- Missing not at random (low abundance)
- Platform-specific dropout

---

## Why Missingness Matters

- Breaks naïve integration methods
- Forces modeling assumptions
- Limits interpretability

---

## Key Takeaways

- Each omics layer answers a different question
- Multi-omics is a *framework*, not a checklist
- Integration requires careful design
- Complexity is the cost of biological realism
