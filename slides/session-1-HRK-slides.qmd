## Session Goals

In this session we will:

- Define the major omics layers and what each measures  
- Distinguish **parallel vs non-parallel** multi-omics  
- Distinguish **integrative vs meta-analytic** approaches  
- Understand **sample-focused vs feature-focused** analyses  
- Recognize **challenges in multi-omics analysis**

---

## What Is Multi-Omics?

> **Multi-omics analysis** integrates multiple molecular data layers measured on the same biological system to capture complementary aspects of regulation, state, and phenotype.

**Key idea:**  
Each omics layer provides a partial and complementary view of biology.

---

## Why Multi-Omics Exists

Single-omic analyses answer limited questions:

- What mutations exist?
- Which genes are expressed?

Multi-omics enables deeper questions:

- Which mutations are *functional*?
- How regulation, expression, and phenotype connect
- Why similar tumors behave differently

---

## The Central Dogma of Biology

**Genome → Epigenome → Transcriptome → Proteome → Metabolome**

- Information flow is *not strictly linear*
- Each layer captures a different biological abstraction
- Integration attempts to recover relationships between layers

*(Insert conceptual figure here — e.g. Hasin et al., Genome Biology 2017)*

---

## Genomics

**Definition**

Genomics characterizes DNA sequence variation, including germline and somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants.

**Common technologies**
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
- Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
- Targeted gene panels

---

## Genomics: Why It Matters

**What genomics tells us**
- Cancer drivers and susceptibility
- Clonal structure and evolution
- What *could* happen biologically

**Concrete example**
- TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas: recurrent somatic mutation landscapes across cancers

**Limitation**
- Genomics does not measure activity or regulation

---

## Epigenomics

**Definition**

Epigenomics measures chromatin state and DNA modifications that regulate gene accessibility without altering DNA sequence.

**Common technologies**
- ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility)
- ChIP-seq / CUT&RUN (TFs, histone marks)
- DNA methylation sequencing (WGBS, RRBS)

---

## Epigenomics: Why It Matters

**What epigenomics tells us**
- Regulatory potential
- Cell identity and lineage memory
- Mechanisms of transcriptional control

**Concrete example**
- CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer

---

## Transcriptomics

**Definition**

Transcriptomics quantifies RNA abundance to capture active gene expression programs.

**Common technologies**
- Bulk RNA-seq
- Single-cell RNA-seq
- Spatial transcriptomics

---

## Transcriptomics: Why It Matters

**What transcriptomics tells us**
- Pathway activation
- Cell states and populations
- Tumor microenvironment composition

**Concrete example**
- Expression-based cancer subtypes (e.g., PAM50 breast cancer)

**Caveat**
- RNA abundance ≠ protein abundance ≠ activity

---

## Proteomics

**Definition**

Proteomics measures protein abundance, modifications, and interactions—the functional machinery of the cell.

**Common technologies**
- Mass spectrometry–based proteomics
- Antibody-based platforms (RPPA, CyTOF)

---

## Proteomics: Why It Matters

**What proteomics tells us**
- Pathway activation at the functional level
- Drug target engagement
- Post-translational regulation

**Concrete example**
- CPTAC showing widespread RNA–protein discordance in tumors

---

## Metabolomics

**Definition**

Metabolomics profiles small molecules reflecting biochemical activity and metabolic flux.

**Common technologies**
- LC-MS / GC-MS
- Targeted vs untargeted metabolomics

---

## Metabolomics: Why It Matters

**What metabolomics tells us**
- Phenotype-proximal biology
- Metabolic reprogramming
- Drug response and toxicity

**Concrete example**
- IDH-mutant gliomas and the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate

---

## Parallel vs Non-Parallel vs. Multi-Modal Multi-Omics

**Non-parallel**
- Different cohorts, platforms, or timepoints
- Requires alignment or meta-analytic thinking

**Parallel (matched samples)**
- Multiple omics measured on the same samples
- Enables direct integration

**Multi-Modal**
- Multiple omics measured from the same tissue, cells, etc.
- Integrated analysis tools are available

---

## Example: Non-Parallel Multi-Omics

- Public RNA-seq + private proteomics cohorts (non-parallel)

How it works (e.g. technologies and data generation)

---

## Example: Non-Parallel Multi-Omics

- Public RNA-seq + private proteomics cohorts (non-parallel)

An example of a study, its figure panel, its main finding

---

## Example: Parallel Multi-Omics

- TCGA: genomics + transcriptomics on same tumors (parallel)

How it works (e.g. technologies and data generation)

## Integrative Analysis vs Meta-Analysis

**Meta-analysis**
- Combine results *after* independent analyses
- Example: overlap of enriched pathways

**Integrative analysis**
- Joint modeling across omics layers
- Example: latent factor models (e.g., MOFA-like frameworks)

---

## Why This Distinction Matters

- Integration ≠ stacking plots
- Different assumptions
- Different failure modes
- Different interpretability

---

## Sample-Focused Multi-Omics

**Primary goal**
- Stratify or cluster samples

**Examples**
- Cancer subtyping
- Patient stratification
- Treatment response prediction

**Unit of analysis**
- Samples

---

## Feature-Focused Multi-Omics

**Primary goal**
- Infer biological mechanisms

**Examples**
- Regulatory networks
- TF → chromatin → RNA relationships
- Signaling cascades

**Unit of analysis**
- Genes, proteins, regulatory elements

---

## Regulatory Network Example

- ATAC-seq identifies accessible enhancers
- TF binding inferred from motifs or CUT&RUN
- RNA-seq links regulation to expression

**Question asked**
> How does regulation drive expression?

---

## Why Spatial Multi-Omics Matters

Bulk and single-cell analyses lose context:

- Bulk averages erase spatial structure
- scRNA-seq loses tissue architecture

**Spatial omics preserves**
- Cell–cell interactions
- Tissue niches
- Functional microenvironments

---

## Spatial Multi-Omics Example

- Tumor–immune boundary signaling
- Stromal gradients influencing cancer progression

**Key insight**
> Same expression ≠ same function in different locations

---

## Challenges in Multi-omics Analysis

So far, we’ve focused on:
- What different omics layers measure
- How multi-omics analyses are performed

Next, we’ll shift to:
- Why multi-omics analyses are challenging in practice

---

## Heterogeneity Across Omics Layers

Common observations:
- RNA–protein discordance
- Open chromatin without expression
- Metabolic changes without transcriptional shifts

**Important framing**
> Disagreement across omics is often the signal, not the noise.

---

## Missing Data in Multi-Omics

**Types of missingness**
- Missing by design (not assayed)
- Missing not at random (low abundance)
- Platform-specific dropout

---

## Why Missingness Matters

- Breaks naïve integration methods
- Forces modeling assumptions
- Limits interpretability

---

## Key Takeaways

- Each omics layer answers a different question
- Multi-omics is a *framework*, not a checklist
- Integration requires careful design
- Complexity is the cost of biological realism
