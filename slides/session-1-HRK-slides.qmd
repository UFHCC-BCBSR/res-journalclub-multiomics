## What Is Multi-Omics?

> **Multi-omics analysis** integrates multiple molecular data layers measured on the same biological system to capture complementary aspects of regulation, state, and phenotype.

**Key idea:** Each omics layer provides a partial and complementary view of biology.

## Why Multi-Omics Exists


::: notes
Single-omic analyses answer limited questions: What mutations exist? Which genes are expressed? Multi-omics enables deeper questions: Which mutations are functional? How regulation, expression, and phenotype connect. Why similar tumors behave differently.

## The Central Dogma of Biology

![Multi-layer information flow from genome to metabolome](figures/central-dogma-multilayer.png)

**Genome → Epigenome → Transcriptome → Proteome → Metabolome**

- Information flow is not strictly linear
- Each layer captures a different biological abstraction

::: notes
Integration attempts to recover relationships between layers. Classic reference: Hasin et al., Genome Biology 2017.

## Genomics

**Definition:** DNA sequence variation including germline and somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and structural variants

**Common technologies:**
- Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
- Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
- Targeted gene panels

![Genomics technology comparison](figures/genomics-technologies.png)

## Genomics: Why It Matters

![TCGA Pan-Cancer mutation landscape showing recurrent drivers](figures/tcga-mutation-landscape.png)

**What genomics tells us:**
- Cancer drivers and susceptibility
- Clonal structure and evolution
- What *could* happen biologically

::: notes
Concrete example: Pan-cancer analysis showing recurrent driver mutations across cancer types, their mutation mechanisms (point mutations, amplifications, etc.), and prognostic associations. Demonstrates how genomics identifies both driver genes and clinically relevant alterations. Key limitation: Genomics does not measure activity or regulation—mutation presence doesn't tell us if the pathway is active or how it's being regulated.
:::

## Epigenomics

**Definition:** Chromatin state and DNA modifications that regulate gene accessibility without altering DNA sequence

**Common technologies:**
- ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility)
- ChIP-seq / CUT&RUN (TFs, histone marks)
- DNA methylation sequencing (WGBS, RRBS)

![Epigenomics assay types and readouts](figures/epigenomics-assays.png)

## Epigenomics: Why It Matters

![CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer](figures/cimp-colorectal.png)

**What epigenomics tells us:**
- Regulatory potential
- Cell identity and lineage memory
- Mechanisms of transcriptional control

::: notes
Concrete example: CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in colorectal cancer shows how epigenetic silencing drives tumorigenesis independent of mutation.
:::

---

## Transcriptomics

**Definition:** RNA abundance capturing active gene expression programs

**Common technologies:**
- Bulk RNA-seq
- Single-cell RNA-seq
- Spatial transcriptomics

![Transcriptomics technology comparison](figures/transcriptomics-technologies.png)

---

## Transcriptomics: Why It Matters

![PAM50 breast cancer subtypes based on expression](figures/pam50-breast-subtypes.png)

**What transcriptomics tells us:**
- Pathway activation
- Cell states and populations
- Tumor microenvironment composition

::: notes
Concrete example: Expression-based cancer subtypes like PAM50 breast cancer classification. Caveat: RNA abundance ≠ protein abundance ≠ activity.
:::

---

## Proteomics

**Definition:** Protein abundance, modifications, and interactions—the functional machinery of the cell

**Common technologies:**
- Mass spectrometry–based proteomics
- Antibody-based platforms (RPPA, CyTOF)

![Proteomics workflow and platforms](figures/proteomics-platforms.png)

---

## Proteomics: Why It Matters

![HER2 assessment across genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers](figures/cptac-her2-multilayer.png)

**What proteomics tells us:**
- Functional protein levels for clinical decisions
- Discordance between genomic/transcriptomic and protein layers
- Post-transcriptional regulation

::: notes
Concrete example: HER2 classification varies by layer—samples HER2+ by protein may be negative by RNA or CNV. RNA-protein correlation is only 0.53. For anti-HER2 therapy decisions, protein measurement is essential. This discordance motivates multi-omics integration to capture regulation from DNA → RNA → protein.
:::

---

## Metabolomics

**Definition:** Small molecules reflecting biochemical activity and metabolic flux

**Common technologies:**
- LC-MS / GC-MS
- Targeted vs untargeted metabolomics

![Metabolomics workflow](figures/metabolomics-workflow.png)

---

## Metabolomics: Why It Matters

![Metabolites as regulatory molecules connecting omics layers](figures/metabolites-in-multiomes.png)


**What metabolomics tells us:**
- Metabolic regulation of epigenetics and protein function
- Phenotype-proximal biology
- Metabolic reprogramming in disease

::: notes
Concrete example: Metabolites like SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) drive DNA/histone methylation, while acetyl-CoA enables histone acetylation. Lactate affects post-translational modifications. Metabolomics reveals how metabolism directly regulates gene expression and protein function, connecting metabolic state to epigenetic and proteomic layers—motivating multi-omics integration.

## Parallel vs Joint Profiling Multi-Omics

**Parallel (matched samples):** Multiple omics on the same samples → direct integration

**Joint Profiling:** Multiple omics from the same cells/tissue → integrated analysis tools

![Schematic showing two multi-omics paradigms](figures/multiomics-paradigms.png)


---

## Parallel Multi-Omics: Study Example

![TCGA study showing mutation-expression relationships](figures/parallel-study-example-tcga.png)

::: notes
Example: TCGA studies showing how somatic mutations correlate with expression subtypes, or how methylation patterns predict clinical outcomes. Main finding should demonstrate cross-layer relationships that wouldn't be visible in single-omic analysis.

## Integrative Analysis vs Meta-Analysis

**Meta-analysis**
- Combine results *after* independent analyses
- Example: overlap of enriched pathways

**Integrative analysis**
- Joint modeling across omics layers
- Example: latent factor models (e.g., MOFA-like frameworks)

---

## Why This Distinction Matters

- Integration ≠ stacking plots
- Different assumptions
- Different failure modes
- Different interpretability

---

## Sample-Focused Multi-Omics

**Primary goal**
- Stratify or cluster samples

**Examples**
- Cancer subtyping
- Patient stratification
- Treatment response prediction

**Unit of analysis**
- Samples

---

## Feature-Focused Multi-Omics

**Primary goal**
- Infer biological mechanisms

**Examples**
- Regulatory networks
- TF → chromatin → RNA relationships
- Signaling cascades

**Unit of analysis**
- Genes, proteins, regulatory elements

---

## Regulatory Network Example

- ATAC-seq identifies accessible enhancers
- TF binding inferred from motifs or CUT&RUN
- RNA-seq links regulation to expression

**Question asked**
> How does regulation drive expression?

---

## Why Spatial Multi-Omics Matters

Bulk and single-cell analyses lose context:

- Bulk averages erase spatial structure
- scRNA-seq loses tissue architecture

**Spatial omics preserves**
- Cell–cell interactions
- Tissue niches
- Functional microenvironments

---

## Spatial Multi-Omics Example

- Tumor–immune boundary signaling
- Stromal gradients influencing cancer progression

**Key insight**
> Same expression ≠ same function in different locations

---

## Challenges in Multi-omics Analysis

So far, we’ve focused on:
- What different omics layers measure
- How multi-omics analyses are performed

Next, we’ll shift to:
- Why multi-omics analyses are challenging in practice

---

## Heterogeneity Across Omics Layers

Common observations:
- RNA–protein discordance
- Open chromatin without expression
- Metabolic changes without transcriptional shifts

**Important framing**
> Disagreement across omics is often the signal, not the noise.

---

## Missing Data in Multi-Omics

**Types of missingness**
- Missing by design (not assayed)
- Missing not at random (low abundance)
- Platform-specific dropout

---

## Why Missingness Matters

- Breaks naïve integration methods
- Forces modeling assumptions
- Limits interpretability

---

## Key Takeaways

- Each omics layer answers a different question
- Multi-omics is a *framework*, not a checklist
- Integration requires careful design
- Complexity is the cost of biological realism
